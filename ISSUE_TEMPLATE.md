Please note that this issue tracker is for reporting bugs in the `simr` package.


Due to time constraints I can no longer provide support for any statistical aspects of your power analysis.

However, do note that unclear usage or unhelpful documentation in `simr` is still a "bug".



If you have found a coding bug, please provide a reproducible example to help me isolate the problem.
